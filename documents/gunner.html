                <p>The Gunner class in Deep Rock Galactic is actually closer to a team medic than any of the other dwarves. With his deployable bubble shield, if things get dicey he can keep himself safe while reviving his teammate(s) and it will keep them safe too once they are up! He also carries a zipline launcher which is more than useful for transporting the rest of the team across huge ravines and getting up through big chasms. One of the main selling points of the Gunner however, is his guns. Packing miniguns, rockets launchers, and a 50-caliber autocannon, any insect no matter how tall, wide, or otherwise large will be turned into swiss cheese in no time. However, this comes with a downside: It costs (roughly) 400,000 nitra to fire any of his weapons for just 10 seconds.</p>
